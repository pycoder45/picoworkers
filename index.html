  For ex. <br>
  Task 1 :  <br>
  •Submit Your username: adibhai45  <br>
  •Submit Poster Username: poster_xyz <br>
   <br>
  Task 2: <br>
  •Submit Your Username: ( adibhai45 ) <br>
  • Submit Name of Token : Dogecoin <br>
   <br>
  Now Only check at <b>"Submit Your Username"</b> Section i have used to brackets to submit my username because if i submit the same text then picoworkers will report me for duplicated task and i will get a timer of 60 second. <br>
  To Avoid this i use some combinations, and every worker does,<b>but now some JOB posters are saying that dont use any combinations only and only put your username........</b>(That we can't do because it is agaisnt policy to submit same proof) <br><br>
  Screenshot of job poster asking : <a href="https://prnt.sc/1dwyb1b">https://prnt.sc/1dwyb1b </a><br><br>
  So, what can we do right now..... <br>
  We must have to use the combination..... <br>
   <br>
  Hope Your Team Will Definitely Find A solution.... <br>
  waiting for your reply.....🙏🙏🙏
